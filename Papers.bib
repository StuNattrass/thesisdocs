  abstract = {The dynamics of species interactions are of central importance for
	the understanding of ecological coexistence, community structure
	and the effects of biological invasions. Using bark beetles that
	colonize the same habitat as an example, we explore species interactions
	in a resource-based model system with positive feedback between insect
	abundance and resource availability. The net interspecies interaction
	was found to be highly dynamic and may alternate in time between
	competition and mutualism. When both bark beetle species were able
	to kill trees (“aggressive”), our simulations showed strong facilitations
	between beetle species. This may lead to escape from control by competition,
	and increase the frequency of outbreaks of tree-killing. The frequency
	of net positive interactions varied with interaction strengths and
	the relative aggressiveness of the species and was highest when both
	species were strongly aggressive; which predicts disastrous outbreaks
	if, e.g., the European spruce bark beetle Ips typographus and the
	North American spruce beetle Dendroctonus rufipennis should become
	interacting species due to introductions. In imbalanced pairs, the
	relatively less aggressive species was facilitated more often than
	the aggressive species. Net positive interactions did not occur for
	strongly inferior species, but their survival was an increasing function
	of interaction strength with aggressive species and availability
	of resources. The benefits for the inferior species in the model
	are consistent with the structure of one aggressive and several less
	aggressive or non-aggressive species, which is common in bark beetle
	communities in many parts of the world.},

	We show that this results not from spatial structure, but instead
	from the assumption that a small difference in mortality translates
	into a large difference in competitive ability. We present graphical
	criteria for recognizing functions that support one, two, or more
	species. High levels of coexistence in models of this form depend
	on a steep slope or a discontinuous second derivative of the function
	relating mortality to competitiveness. These criteria are identical
	to those in models of interference competition that lack explicit

  year = {2001},
  volume = {158},
  pages = {572--584},
  number = {6},
  abstract = {Patch occupancy theory predicts that a trade-off between competition
	and dispersal should lead to regional coexistence of competing species.
	Empirical investigations, however, find local coexistence of superior
	and inferior competitors, an outcome that cannot be explained within
	the patch occupancy framework because of the decoupling of local
	and spatial dynamics. We develop two-patch metapopulation models
	that explicitly consider the interaction between competition and
	dispersal. We show that a dispersal-competition trade-off can lead
	to local coexistence provided the inferior competitor is superior
	at colonizing empty patches as well as immigrating among occupied
	patches. Immigration from patches that the superior competitor cannot
	colonize rescues the inferior competitor from extinction in patches
	that both species colonize. Too much immigration, however, can be
	detrimental to coexistence. When competitive asymmetry between species
	is high, local coexistence is possible only if the dispersal rate
	of the inferior competitor occurs below a critical threshold. If
	competing species have comparable colonization abilities and the
	environment is otherwise spatially homogeneous, a superior ability
	to immigrate among occupied patches cannot prevent exclusion of the
	inferior competitor. If, however, biotic or abiotic factors create
	spatial heterogeneity in competitive rankings across the landscape,
	local coexistence can occur even in the absence of a dispersal-competition
	trade-off. In fact, coexistence requires that the dispersal rate
	of the overall inferior competitor not exceed a critical threshold.
	Explicit consideration of how dispersal modifies local competitive
	interactions shifts the focus from the patch occupancy approach with
	its emphasis on extinction-colonization dynamics to the realm of
	source-sink dynamics. The key to coexistence in this framework is
	spatial variance in fitness. Unlike in the patch occupancy framework,
	high rates of dispersal can undermine coexistence, and hence diversity,
	by reducing spatial variance in fitness.},

	to the sapling stage in artificially created gaps in secondary forest
	on the Barro Colorado Nature Monument, Panamá.
	
	2
	
	?To simulate microsite variation within gaps, litter addition/removal
	and soil disturbance treatments were applied to seedling plots in
	a factorial design.
	
	3
	
	?Seedling emergence was almost three-fold higher in litter-free plots
	than in control plots.
	
	4
	
	?We found a negative relationship between seed mass and seed abundance
	in the soil, seed mass was positively correlated with seedling emergence
	success from the seed bank and with seedling survival through to
	the end of the first dry season.
	
	5
	
	?In the 18 months following the first dry season we observed an uncoupling
	of seed mass from seedling performance. Seedling mortality was now
	a function of maximum relative growth rate, with higher mortality
	of fast-growing species attributable to herbivory, notably by shoot-borers.
	
	6
	
	?We propose that a seed size-dependent trade-off between dispersal
	success (selecting for large seed number), and emergence–establishment
	success (selecting for large seed size) can explain the maintenance
	of wide variation in seed size among pioneer species. Secondarily,
	a trade-off between growth rate and susceptibility to herbivores
	acting at the post-establishment phase may contribute to observed
	differences in light requirements among pioneer species.},

  abstract = {The evolution of cooperation is an enduring conundrum in biology and
	the social sciences. Two social dilemmas, the prisoner's dilemma
	and the snowdrift game have emerged as the most promising mathematical
	metaphors to study cooperation. Spatial structure with limited local
	interactions has long been identified as a potent promoter of cooperation
	in the prisoner's dilemma but in the spatial snowdrift game, space
	may actually enhance or inhibit cooperation. Here we investigate
	and link the microscopic interaction between individuals to the characteristics
	of the emerging macroscopic patterns generated by the spatial invasion
	process of cooperators in a world of defectors. In our simulations,
	individuals are located on a square lattice with Moore neighborhood
	and update their strategies by probabilistically imitating the strategies
	of better performing neighbors. Under sufficiently benign conditions,
	cooperators can survive in both games. After rapid local equilibration,
	cooperators expand quadratically until global saturation is reached.
	Under favorable conditions, cooperators expand as a large contiguous
	cluster in both games with minor differences concerning the shape
	of embedded defectors. Under less favorable conditions, however,
	distinct differences arise. In the prisoner's dilemma, cooperators
	break up into isolated, compact clusters. The compact clustering
	reduces exploitation and leads to positive assortment, such that
	cooperators interact more frequently with other cooperators than
	with defectors. In contrast, in the snowdrift game, cooperators form
	small, dendritic clusters, which results in negative assortment and
	cooperators interact more frequently with defectors than with other
	cooperators. In order to characterize and quantify the emerging spatial
	patterns, we introduce a measure for the cluster shape and demonstrate
	that the macroscopic patterns can be used to determine the characteristics
	of the underlying microscopic interactions.},

	The coevolution of strategies in polymorphic populations, however,

  abstract = {Trade-offs in species performances of different ecological functions
	is one of the most common explanations for coexistence in communities.
	Despite the potential for species coexistence occurring at local
	or regional spatial scales, trade-offs are typically approached at
	a single scale. In recent years, ecologists have increasingly provided
	evidence for the importance of community processes at both local
	and regional spatial scales. This review summarizes the theoretical
	predictions for the traits associated with trade-offs under different
	conditions and at different spatial scales. We provide a spatial
	framework for understanding trade-offs, coexistence and the supportive
	empirical evidence. Predictions are presented that link the patterns
	of diversity observed to the patterns of trade-offs that lead to
	coexistence at different spatial scales. Recent evidence for the
	evolution of trade-offs under different conditions is provided which
	explores both laboratory microcosm studies and phylogenetic tests.
	Examining trade-offs within a spatial framework can provide a strong
	approach to understanding community structure and dynamics, while
	explaining patterns of species diversity.},

	We examined the species richness of theoretical communities in relation
	to interaction strength between species.
	
	2
	
	To do so, we used randomly constructed interaction matrices for competitive
	systems. To determine co-existence, we tested for local stability
	and equilibrium feasibility of these theoretical assemblages.
	
	3
	
	As expected, we found that a low mean species interaction strength
	could allow for many species to co-exist. However, variance in the
	interaction strengths may alter previous results; two systems with
	the same mean interaction strength show markedly different diversity
	depending critically on the magnitude of the variance. If species
	are similar enough then many can co-exist, even if they compete strongly.
	
	4
	
	In addition we found that the species richness of a competitive community
	can greatly depend on the correlation between interaction strengths,
	an issue that so far has gone unreported. This correlation, a result
	of trade-offs between species’ characteristics, may profoundly increase
	the potential for stable co-existence of a highly species-rich community.
	
	5
	
	Competition may not be an anathema to diversity. Statistical properties
	of species’ interactions may be critical factors that contribute
	to the explanation of species diversity in natural communities.},

  abstract = {It has been suggested that the structure of ecological communities
	is constrained by dynamical instability of certain configurations
	of interacting species. Analysis of this has most often been based
	on asymptotic (local) stability analysis of equilibria at which all
	species are present, on the grounds that a configuration with an
	unstable equilibrium is less likely to occur in the real world than
	one with an asymptotically stable equilibrium. Since species may
	also coexist on limit cycles or chaotic orbits, we argue that a global
	condition that species should increase when rare could be more appropriate.
	Conditions for such "permanence" exist and their use makes it possible
	to focus on fundamental qualitative questions of coexistence of species,
	even though the quantitative properties of their dynamics may be
	very complex. We describe a straightforward and general method for
	distinguishing between permanent and nonpermanent Lotka—Volterra
	food webs; this method is due to Jansen (1987). A numerical analysis
	of four—species food webs with different degrees of omnivory shows
	that many that would be rejected as unstable in a local analysis
	are at the same time permanent in the global analysis. Using permanence
	methods, food webs of high connectance are shown to rebuild themselves
	more readily than those of low connectance, and therefore to recover
	more readily from disturbance than those of low connectance. The
	significance of this result for the relationship between complexity
	and stability of communities is discussed, together with the merits
	and drawbacks of permanence for studying the coexistence of species
	in communities.},

  abstract = {Seed size commonly varies by five to six orders of magnitude among
	coexisting plant species, a pattern ecologists have long sought to
	explain. Because seed size trades off with seed number, small-seeded
	species clearly have the advantage in fecundity, but what is the
	countervailing advantage of large seeds? Higher competitive ability
	combined with strong competitive asymmetry can in theory allow coexistence
	through a competition–colonization trade-off, but empirical evidence
	is inconsistent with this mechanism. Instead, the key advantage of
	large seeds appears to be their tolerance of stresses such as shade
	or drought that are present in some but not all regeneration sites.
	Here I present a simple, analytically tractable model of species
	coexistence in heterogeneous habitats through a tolerance–fecundity
	trade-off. Under this mechanism, the more tolerant species win all
	of the more stressful regeneration sites and some of those that are
	less stressful, whereas the more fecund species win most but not
	all of the less stressful sites. The tolerance–fecundity trade-off
	enables stable coexistence of large numbers of species in models
	with and without seed limitation. The tolerance–fecundity mechanism
	provides an excellent explanation for the maintenance of diversity
	of seed size within plant communities and also suggests new hypotheses
	for coexistence in animal and microbial communities.},

	In contrast to the resource-reduction model of symmetric competition
	for a single resource, the model we present predicts that outcomes
	of asymmetric competition for light will sometimes depend on the
	timing of establishment and the consequent hierarchy among species
	in canopy position. Competitive outcomes in the model depend on the
	minimum light requirements (Lc) and self-shading of species lower
	in the canopy compared to the light available (Lout*) beneath species
	higher in the canopy. Succession progresses towards species with
	decreasing values for Lc, but arrested successions occur when initial
	dominants have relatively high values for Lc but low values for Lout*,
	leading to founder control. A theoretically limitless number of species
	may coexist in competition for light when dominance is founder controlled.
	These model predictions have implications for an array of applied
	ecological questions, including methods to control invasive species
	in light-limited restored ecosystems.},

	1) the number of seeds produced via a size-number trade-off and 2)
	competitive ability - plants arising from large seeds are assumed
	to have a competitive advantage over those derived from small seeds.
	In this setting the existence of a single-species global ESS seed
	mass requires the competitive advantage of large seeds over small
	ones to be unbounded. If there is a limit on the competitive advantage
	that large seeds obtain then it is always possible to find a smaller
	seed mass that will successfully invade. In such circumstances there
	might be a multi-species coevolutionarily stable coalition of several
	species each with a different seed mass. In this way a wide range
	of seed masses could be promoted by evolution. In general the adaptive
	landscape generated by these models is extremely flat leading to
	slow evolutionary dynamics. The implications of these results for
	the interpretation of observational, comparative and experimental

  abstract = {This paper studies a class of dynamical systems that model multi-species
	ecosystems. These systems are ‘resource bounded’ in the sense that
	species compete to utilize an underlying limiting resource or substrate.
	This boundedness means that the relevant state space can be reduced
	to a simplex, with coordinates representing the proportions of substrate
	utilized by the various species. If the vector field is inward pointing
	on the boundary of the simplex, the state space is forward invariant
	under the system flow, a requirement that can be interpreted as the
	presence of non-zero exogenous recruitment. We consider conditions
	under which these model systems have a unique interior equilibrium
	that is globally asymptotically stable. The systems we consider generalize
	classical multi-species Lotka–Volterra systems, the behaviour of
	which is characterized by properties of the community (or interaction)
	matrix. However, the more general systems considered here are not
	characterized by a single matrix, but rather a family of matrices.
	We develop a set of ‘explicit conditions’ on the basis of a notion
	of ‘uniform diagonal dominance’ for such a family of matrices, that
	allows us to extract a set of sufficient conditions for global asymptotic
	stability based on properties of a single, derived matrix. Examples
	of these explicit conditions are discussed.},

  abstract = {All organisms, especially terrestrial plants and other sessile species,
	interact mainly with their neighbors, but neighborhoods can differ
	in composition because of dis- persal and mortality. There is increasingly
	strong evidence that the spatial structure created by these forces
	profoundly influences the dynamics, composition, and biodiversity
	of com- munities.
	
	Nonspatial models predict that no more consumer species can coexist
	at equilibrium than there are limiting resources. In contrast, a
	similar model that includes neighborhood competition and random dispersal
	among sites predicts stable coexistence of a potentially unlimited
	number of species on a single resource. Coexistence occurs because
	species with sufficiently high dispersal rates persist in sites not
	occupied by superior competitors. Co- existence requires limiting
	similarity and two-way or three-way interspecific trade-offs among
	competitive ability, colonization ability, and longevity.
	
	This spatial competition hypothesis seems to explain the coexistence
	of the numerous plant species that compete for a single limiting
	resource in the grasslands of Cedar Creek Natural History Area. It
	provides a testable, alternative explanation for other high diversity
	communities, such as tropical forests. The model can be tested (1)
	by determining if coexisting species have the requisite trade-offs
	in colonization, competition, and longevity, (2) by addition of propagules
	to determine if local species abundances are limited by dispersal,
	and (3) by comparisons of the effects on biodiversity of high rates
	of propagule addition for species that differ in competitive ability.},

  abstract = {{Five grass species (Agrostis scabra, Agropyron repens, Poa pratensis,
	Schizachyrium scoparium and Andropogon gerardi) were grown in monoculture
	for 3 yr on an experimental nitrogen gradient. The species differed
	significantly in the levels to which they reduced soil solution (0.01
	mol/L KCl extractable) nitrate and ammonium concentrations and light
	penetration to the soil surface. Soil nitrate concentration was an
	inverse function of root mass, which explained 73\% of the observed
	variance in nitrate. Other species differences explained an additional
	9.2\%, and total soil N an additional 5\% of this variance. Extractable
	soil ammonium also depended on these variables, but total soil N
	explained the most variance. Light penetration to the soil surface
	in these monocultures was a negative exponential function of aboveground
	biomass (R2 = 0.79). Schizachyrium and Andropogon, the species that
	reduced soil solution N to the lowest levels on infertile soils,
	had lower vegetative growth rates, higher root allocation, lower
	reproductive allocation, and lower tissue N than the other species.
	Many of these traits are associated with plants of infertile habitats,
	suggesting a direct link between ecophysiology, resource reduction,
	and distributional patterns. Because all species survived on even
	our most nitrogen-poor soil (subsurface sand), differential nutrient
	reduction, not tolerance, may be the main mechanism favoring these
	traits in infertile habitats. On infertile soils, the three earlier
	successional species (Agrostis, Agropyron, and Poa) allocated more
	to reproduction (rhizome or seed) than the later successional species,
	but did not reduce soil solution nitrate and ammonium to as low levels.
	This suggests that our early successional species may be superior
	colonists but inferior nitrogen competitors compared to the prairie
	bunchgrasses. Our results can be used to make explicit predictions
	as to the outcome of nitrogen competition among all possible combinations
	of these five species.}},

	models of species coexistence assume that propagules of superior

	competition). But if adults are invulnerable to displacement by propagules
	(as trees are to seeds), and propagules compete to replace adults
	that die for reasons independent of the outcome of juvenile competition
	(a lottery system), a competition-colonization trade-off alone is
	not able to produce coexistence. However, we show that coexistence
	is possible if patch density varies spatially, such that it becomes
	a niche axis. We also show how a dispersal-fecundity trade-off can
	partition variation in patch density. We discuss the application
	of these models to empirical systems. An important implication of
	communities coexisting via variation in patch density is that the
	amount of habitat loss necessarily interacts with the pattern of
	loss in affecting extinctions, invasions, and coexistence, in contrast
	to displacement competition models, for which the spatial pattern
	of loss is not important or is less important. Finally, with respect
	to mechanisms promoting coexistence, we suggest that trade-offs between
	different stages of colonization could be far more common in nature
